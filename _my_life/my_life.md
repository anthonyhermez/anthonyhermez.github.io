Bio
------
I'm a first-generation Lebanese-American graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on computer architecture and digital design. My passion lies in understanding how systems work at the hardware level and contributing to the development of efficient, high-performance computing technologies.<br>

Being a first-gen college student has motivated me to give back by supporting other students navigating similar paths. I’ve worked as a teaching assistant for over 1000 students and have mentored over 100 fellow students, helping them build confidence in technical and professional skills, as well as navigate the challenges of engineering coursework.

I spend my time on personal projects that explore the intersection of high-performance computing and digital design. I'm especially interested in understanding the underlying math behind high-performance applications to better exploit tradeoffs in the hardware design. I am currently trying to teach myself Functional Analysis using [Dr. Todd Abogast's online notes](https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~arbogast/appMath08c.pdf).

Hobbies
------
Outside of academics, I stay balanced by pursuing a few of my favorite hobbies. I play cello with the [UT University Orchestra](https://music.utexas.edu/ensembles/university-orchestra) and am an officer for [Cellos at Texas](https://cellos-at-texas.my.canva.site/). I’m also part of the [salsa club](https://www.instagram.com/texaslatindance/?hl=en), which I joined after having never danced prior to college. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, cooking, and reading. I am currently reading through a collection of [Paulo Coelho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Coelho) books, finishing up _The Witch of Portobello_.
