👨🏻‍💻 I’m a final year M.S. ECE student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).

🔬 In undergrad, I double majored in [ECE](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.utexas.edu/) with a Minor in [Computational Engineering](https://oden.utexas.edu/).

📚 I’m currently working as the head TA for [Intro to Embedded Systems](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/mspm0/).

🎻 I also play cello for the [UT University Orchestra](https://music.utexas.edu/ensembles/university-orchestra) and am learning Arabic and Spanish.
