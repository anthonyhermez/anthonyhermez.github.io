FPGA Engineer Intern
------
**Applied Research Laboratories** (Austin, TX)<br>
June 2025 - August 2025<br>
_VHDL, SystemVerilog, TCL, Python, FPGA, Vivado, Digital Communications_<br><br>
- Designed RTL in VHDL for accelerating signal processing and digital communication applications.
- Studied multiple Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) across code rates, BERs, and computational complexity to contribute to system design decision.
- Automated verfication of RTL using SystemVerilog and TCL.

SoC Design Verification Engineer Intern
------
**Apple** (Austin, TX)<br>
May 2024 - August 2024<br>
_Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM, IP Verification, Full-chip Verification, AXI Protocol_<br><br>
- Developed a complete UVM testbench for a distributed MMU IP in SystemVerilog.
- Leveraged Cadence Verification IP to control AXI bus transactions.
- Verified the entire IP block, including regression and coverage closure.
- Wrote timing assertions in a full-chip SoC IP.

Validation Engineer Intern
------
**Texas Instruments** (Dallas, TX)<br>
May 2023 - August 2023<br>
_Analog Circuit Design, Altium, Circuit Analysis, Hardware Testing_<br><br>
- Designed and prototyped an analog circuit that isolated high voltage from a temperature forcing unit (more commonly called thermostream) while allowing small signals from a thermocouple to pass through.
- Tested final design in a control loop with the thermostream, achieving an accuracy of less than +/-1 degC.
- Captured final design in Altium.

Embedded Software Engineer Intern
------
**Applied Reserach Laboratories** (Austin, TX)<br>
June 2022 - December 2022<br>
_C, C++, Java, RF Analysis, Software Architecture_<br><br>
- Programmed firmware in C++ for a high-frequency radio-link simulator to interface with analog and digital attenuators.
- Hardware debugging of voltage-variable attenuators and DACs using spectrum analyzers and multimeters, respectively.
- Modified the GUI to allow the user to select between attenuation modes using Java SWT libraries.

Undergraduate Research Assistant
------
**The University of Texas at Austin** (Austin, TX)<br>
January 2022 - December 2022<br>
_Python, Atomic Force Microscope, Magnetic Devices_<br><br>
- Tested ferromagnetic memristors fabricated using different 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) by performing sweep voltage and magnetic field tests to analyze I-V and H-V relationships of each device.
- Developed a data plotting Python script using Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas libraries that style
- Certified in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging.
